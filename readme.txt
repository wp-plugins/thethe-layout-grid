TheThe Layout Grid WP plugin allows you to display either standard 960px, 1200px layout grids or your custom one.

== Description ==

[TheThe Layout Grid](http://thethefly.com/wp-plugins/thethe-layout-grid/ "TheThe Layout Grid") WordPress plug-in allows you to display either standard 960px, 1200px layout grids or your custom grid of any size and configuration over any of your WP page to help you better structure your design. You can even create different grids for different pages.

This plugin was created for WP themes designers who love 960px grid system offered by Nathan Smith but want to move forward to keep the modern tendencies of the current Web industry. Or simply for those who love the system but want to be different.

With our grids, side margins are no longer calculated as a half of a gutter. You can specify them as well as other parameters what adds even more flexibility to our universal layout grid system.

NEW! Advanced usage: you can leave your plugin disabled at the plugin settings page not to load a grid over your page for general visitors but still force activating a grid of any configuration over any page but sending special parameters in the URL:

?grid=1&vEnabled=1&hEnabled=1&gridCenter=1&backlink=1&system=960x12&vColor=FF0000&vOpacity=0.15&vMargin=10&vGutter=20&vColWidth=60&vColNumber=12&vContentWidth=940&vFullWidth=960&hColor=C0C0C0&hOpacity=0.3&hHeight=18&hOffset=1
